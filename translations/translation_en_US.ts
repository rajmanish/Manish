In    the    spirit    of   our    rich   cultural    heritage   let   me    begin    with   a    Sanskrit shloka:

Patratvat    Dhanamapnoti,    Dhanat    Dharmam    Tatah   Sukham
This   translates   to
Knowledge    gives    humility   from    humility   one   attains    worthiness    with   worthiness   one    gains   wealth   and   from   wealth   righteousness   and  happiness  follow.
